    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">Galileo Galilei</a> (1564 - 1642), the father of modern observational astronomy and the father of science, discovered the <strong>Phases of Venus </strong> through his telescope and documented
      Jupiter's Galilean Moons for the first time. His observations supported the Copernican cosmology over its predecessors. </p>
    <p> The Copernican Revolution came to an end only when Sir <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton">Isaac Newton</a> (1642 - 1726) formulated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation">Law of Universal Gravitation </a>      and his famous <strong>Three Laws of Motion</strong>. Gravitation removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of Solar System. A point where our modern view of the Solar System solidified and with it dawned the age of classical
      physics â€” a <em>Scientific Revolution</em>. </p>
