    <p class="chapter-begin">It took more than a thousand years and <em>courage</em> to figure out what our Solar System looks like. How it works. Up until the sixteenth century only five planets were known to man. People believed that Earth was at the center of the
      Universe and that Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn turned around it in succeeding celestial spheres. Strictly in that order. </p>
    <p> This was the Geocentric model, see visual overleaf, that ancient astronomer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a> (c. 87-150 AD) postulated almost 1 500 years before Copernicus. In 1543, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus </a>      (1473-1543), in his book <em>De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium</em>, published a new model with a stationary Sun at the center of the other planets â€” the heliocentric model. Copernicus also put planets in their correct order i.e. Mercury, Venus,
      Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
