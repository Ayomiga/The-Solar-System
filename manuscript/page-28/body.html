    <p> Surface of the Sun is its photosphere, followed by chromosphere and then the corona. Towards the center of Sun there is a convective zone, a tachocline, a radiative zone and then the Core â€” the seat of nuclear fusion. Temperature on Sun is thought
      to vary from about 3800-5800K in the photosphere to ~15.7 million K at the core. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/The-Solar-System/master/assets/images/sun-layers.jpg" / width="100%">
    <p> In addition to heat and light, the Sun also emits a stream of charged particles (electrons and protons) known as the Solar Wind. These high energy particles cause spectacular effects called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">Aurora</a>      on Earth, especially at the magnetic poles. </p>
