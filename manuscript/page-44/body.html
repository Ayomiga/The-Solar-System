      Where if the mass of the Earth were one, the mass of the Moon relative to the earth would be 0.012. Substituting for values, we get the distance from Earth's center to the barycenter of the Earth-Moon system.

      Since the radius of Earth is 3,959 miles, it means that the barycenter is located inside of Earth at about 1121 miles below its surface. Could anything weird happen in there at the level of barycenter? Well, it depends. Gravitational forces may loosen
      rocks a bit, push magmatic material up and that in turn could trigger an earthquake â€” but it is a conjecture not fully understood yet.
