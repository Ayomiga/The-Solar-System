        <h4>Parsec </h4>
        <blockquote> - a unit of distance used in astronomy, equal to about 3.26 light years. One parsec corresponds to the distance at which the mean radius of the earth's orbit subtends an angle of one second of arc. </blockquote>
        <p> Parsec is a trigonometric approach to define a unit of distance. Following is a nice tutorial from the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/cosmology-and-astronomy/stellar-life-topic/stellar-parallax-tutorial/v/parsec-definition">Khan Academy</a> that explains parsec and its relationship to light year.</p>
