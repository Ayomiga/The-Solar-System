    <p> Mars has polar ice caps of water and dry ice. It is thought that Mars once had very large rivers of water but they were lost to space in absence of enough gravity and a lack of protective atmosphere. Measurements suggest that Mars continues to leave
      a trail of atmospheric elements behind itself on its orbit i.e. it continues to lose its atmosphere. </p> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bubblin/The-Solar-System/master/images/page-45/polar-ice.jpg" width="100%" /> </div>
