    <h1>The Doomsday Argument </h1>
    <p> The Doomsday argument (DA) is a probabilistic argument that, simply put, says that supposing the humans alive today are in a random place in the whole timeline of human history, chances are that we are about halfway through our survival history already.
      That there is a 95% chance of an extinction event within the next 9,120 years. </p>
    <p> Human colonization of other objects such as Mars, Moon or nearby planets thus makes for a better chance of survival for our species, should Earth face a cataclysmic event. </p>
