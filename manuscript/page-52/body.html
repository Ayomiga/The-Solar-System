    <p> In fact, of all the planets in the Solar System, the seasons of Mars are the most Earth-like. Only the length of a Martian season is twice of that on Earth. Surface temperature of Mars ranges from about −143 °C (−225 °F) during winters at the poles
      to ~35 °C (95 °F) during summer at the equator. On an average, Mars is much colder than our Antartican South Pole.</p>
    <p> The Martian surface is very feature-rich and remarkable. It has the largest known volcano of our Solar System – <a href="">The Olympus Mons </a> - that is about 375 miles wide and ~69,000 feet high. It has a grander canyon - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valles_Marineris">The Valles Marineris</a>      - that is ~2,500 miles long and up to 4 miles deep. In comparison the Grand Canyon of Arizona is only ~500 miles in length and only a mile deep. </p>
