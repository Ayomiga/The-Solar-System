    <h2> Eclipse</h2>
    <p> Now that we have covered the Sun, the Moon and the Earth let's take a look at Eclipses: </p>
    <blockquote><em> An eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when a heavenly object is temporarily obscured, either by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the observer. </em></blockquote>
    <p> On Earth we get to see two kinds of eclipses: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> A Solar eclipse — in which the sun is obscured by the moon. </li>
      <li> Lunar eclipse — in which the moon appears darkened as it passes into the earth's shadow. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> There are three types solar and lunar eclipses too — total, partial and penumbral — the most dramatic being a total lunar eclipse, in which Earth's shadow completely covers the moon. Eclipses and other interesting configurations or alignments of objects
      are also loosely called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syzygy_%28astronomy%29">Syzygy</a>. </p>
