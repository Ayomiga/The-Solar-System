    <p> Synchronous rotation is caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a> of Moon to Earth. This locking has a great influence on the life on Earth. For example, it causes oceanic buldging, causes low and high tides,
      stabilizes Earth's rotational axis and even decelerates Earth's rotation due to <em>tidal braking</em>. </p>
    <p> There is a school of thought that believes that complex life on Earth wouldn't have been possible without the Moon. Note both Moon and Sun are visible to our naked eye and both do not look like starry dots in the sky. </p>

    <p> Moon has a very thin atmosphere made up of mostly Argon, Helium and Hydrogen. This means that its surface is unprotected from cosmic rays, meteorites and solar winds. It has a wide variation of temperature that goes from very hot at 107 °C during
      the day to very cold down to -153 °C at night.</p>
    <p> Lack of atmosphere also means that sound couldn't be heard on the Moon and the sky appears black even during the day. Here's a little science quest for you: Find out why our sky is blue in color during the day? </p>
