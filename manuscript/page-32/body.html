    <p> There is a school of thought that believes that complex life on Earth wouldn't have been possible without the Moon. </p>
    <h2> Formation & Evolution</h2>
    <p>Moon was formed roughly 30 to 50 million years after the birth of the Solar System. It is thought that a Mars sized object named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_(planet)">Theia</a> smashed into proto-Earth (early molten Earth) blasting
      off materials that later accreted to form the Moon. However, this is a theoretical explanation according to what the existing data and observation of the Earth-Moon system indicates. </p>
