    <p> Synchronous rotation is caused by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking">tidal locking</a> of Moon to Earth. This locking has a great influence on the life on Earth. For example, it causes oceanic buldging, causes low and high tides,
      stabilizes Earth's rotational axis and even decelerates Earth's rotation due to <em>tidal braking</em>. </p>
    <p> There is a school of thought that believes that complex life on Earth wouldn't have been possible without the Moon. Note both Moon and Sun are visible to our naked eye and both of them do not look like starry dots in the sky. </p>
