    <p> The list of people who have helped me complete this book, like outer space, is mind boggling. In no particular order I want to thank:</p>
    <p> Sonica, my wife, for making my life beautiful. </p>
    <p> Okay in no particular order, I want to thank all my friends in India — Nilesh, Ratan, Deepak, Niraj, Vaibhav Dhanda and Navneet, all my friends in the Bay Area — Mohit Gupta, John Clover, Abhishek, all my friends in Washington DC — Satie, Sameer,
      Rajat, Anisur, Ravneet, Ankit, Pooja, Anjul, Harpreet, Shweta and my new friends at the tennis court — Chandrabhan, Vikram, Niraj, Phoo, A.J. and many others.</p>
    <p> I could not have pulled this off without your love & support. </p>
    <p>A very special thanks to Manish and Anshu, California, particularly to their beautiful daughters Sanvi (11yo) and Svana (4yo). </p>
