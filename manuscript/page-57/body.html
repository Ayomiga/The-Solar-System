    <p>An interesting thing about Mars is that it has two Moons: Phobos and Deimos. Imagine what fun it'd be to watch two Moons every night? But the Martian moons are small, roughly shaped rocks orbiting very close to the planet. Phobos is only 14 and Deimos
      is 8 miles across. Phobos is only 3,700 miles away from the surface of Mars whereas Deimos is 12,400 miles away. Compared to that our Moon is 2,160 miles in diatmeter and is almost 287,000 miles away from Earth. </p>
    <p> Mars has a very elongated orbit, i.e. eccentric elliptical orbit. This causes a wide variation in its climate as the planet moves away from or gets closer to the Sun. Mars rotates about its axis in roughly 24 hours, 37 minutes, a day that is nearly
      equal to that of Earth. But it takes twice as much time to go around the Sun as Earth does. Mars is also inclined at 25.19Â° to its orbital plane so it too, like Earth, has seasons. </p>
