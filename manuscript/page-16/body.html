        <p> Man has <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/apollo11.html#.VMmgpYrF_xh">been on the Moon</a> and countless probes have been delivered successfully to nearby planets and comet that continue to collect and send useful data to us. In other words, Astronomy continues to expand our horizon and yet our journey to space â€” to observe, discover and assimilate the knowledge of the Universe has only begun.</p>
        <p> This book aims to connect the dots and help us understand our Solar System better.
         It aims to give us a glimpse of how our planetary system works, what our planets are made up of and how these massive bodies interact with each other gravitationally. To appreciate how odd and unique our own planet Earth is, with all its teeming life and biodiversity.</p>
